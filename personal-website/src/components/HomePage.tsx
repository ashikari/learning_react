          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I'm a Machine Learning engineer at Cruise, focusing on self-driving car planning. I develop closed-loop, GPU-based simulations to support pre- and post-training of foundational driving models, with a particular interest in post-training. My work also extends to multimodal generative modeling, where Iâ€™m exploring new ways to enhance autonomous vehicle capabilities. With a solid background in ML and robotics, along with experience in mechanical design, I aim to bridge advanced modeling with real-world, impactful applications..</p>
