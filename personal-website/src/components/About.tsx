      <p>
        I'm a Machine Learning engineer with expertise in robotics and a background in mechanical design. 
        I currently work at Cruise, focusing on closed-loop GPU-based simulation for self-driving car planning.
        Iâ€™m also interested in multimodal generative modeling, especially in post-training applications.
